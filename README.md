# HirePurpose

HirePurpose is a web app for helping in the hiring decision process. Instead of typical statuses that show where a candidate is at in the process (i.e. Phone Screen, Interview, etc.), HirePurpose aims to be **fun and honest** by letting you choose how you *feel* about hiring each candidate. We all know that hiring is highly subjective anyway, why not embrace it?

## Features

* Typical CRUD operations for candidates
* Candidates sort from most to least likely to be hired (with undecided at the bottom)
* Simple user authentication with a test account for reviewers
* Support for resumes, cover letters, and notes for all candidates
